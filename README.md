# Kip McGrath Learning Platform

A learning platform undertaken on behalf of Kip McGrath. A student project for the team projects and professionalism module.

The live application can be viewed [***here.***](https://kipmcgrath.netlify.app/)  

## Setup
The project contains two directories `/client` & `/server`. The server directory does not need to be ran locally as this is hosted separately, however this does contain the source code for the api in the event it needs to be evaluated.

To run the client locally enter the following commands into your terminal or powershell:

    git clone https://github.com/Alex-Tomo/team-projects-and-professionalism.git
    cd team-projects-and-professionalism
    npm install
    
    ----- wait for installation -----
    
    npm run start
